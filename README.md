# Toggle Reddit Sidebar

Forked from the "Hide Reddit Side Bar" userscript by u/pm\_all\_ahri\_art (Jonathan Ma on GreasyFork, found here: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/375201-hide-reddit-side-bar.

Adds a button to toggle the sidebar on Reddit, with a variable to have it hidden or shown by default.

Currently, the default mode can be changed by manually editing the variable "IsHidden" to either true or false. A toggle switch in the extension menu is planned.
